# to-do-list
This is a todo list using a unique id library so i can identify each list item and update the array that stores each item properly as well as remove the div that has the item.
so far i created the logic for the items and the projects that hold the items. i created a default list array that will store all the items in date order (have to 
figure this logic out), 

then display the divs. each project has its own array, so each item created has a unique id which will be set to its data-id allowing for easy deletion from the display as well as from the array.

// 
im going to stop coding for tonight (most likely) but i will figure out the rest of the changes i have to make for all the logic to work as well as how it would work with the display
