# to-do-list
This is a todo list using a unique id library so i can identify each list item and update the array that stores each item properly as well as remove the div that has the item.
so far i created the logic for the items and the projects that hold the items. i created a default list array that will store all the items in date order (have to 
figure this logic out), 

then display the divs. each project has its own array, so each item created has a unique id which will be set to its data-id allowing for easy deletion from the display as well as from the array.

// 
im going to stop coding for tonight (most likely) but i will figure out the rest of the changes i have to make for all the logic to work as well as how it would work with the display

  some more html and styling has been done, 
  next i want to sort and style the home,today and this week buttons, 
  probably move the add projects button next to the projects header, 
  and create a tiny div which will store the projects using overflow: scroll;
  as well as an "x" button to delete the project and edit to change name,

//6/12/23 320pm
im creating a decent looking barebones skeleton that will be responsive to js 
//the buttons home today week buttons look better 
the projects section on the side bar has a dummy project and a button to add more projects underneath
ill create an input option on top of add projects button under the title edit x div 
to add more projects and toggle whenver submitted
i added a todo item button under the list items as well, 

 a modal with a title, description,priority level,due date 

next i want to make the edit and x button spaced better on the side bar 
i want the calendar edit and x button next to eahc other on the right side of the lsit item,

after that ill go back to javscript to work on the logic to make the page responsive,final styling after thats done 


//6/13/23 1:45pm
//everything from the 320pm update  from yesterday is done, so now its time to go back to the javascript to make the page responsive and then final styling to make it all look good.

/the add project and add todo buttons close and open the submission form/modals that are relevant to them/

next i want add project form to create another title div on top of it and i want the todo submission form to add a task div on top of it. 
    i also have to add these to a respective array,

then after that i will make the edit and x buttons, edit content on the display and the array  or delete content on the display  and in the array. 

then i will make home display all items on the array, today will display items due today and this week will display items within the week. 

i think the edit buttons should open up the input form or modal but with the info on that specific div.

also project textcontent should be the relevent topic, either a specific project or the home,today or week section. 

 after all this is done the page should be styled to look good 
    as well as change buttons to svg pic/icons and add one on top.

/the add project form input is responsive and adds divs as well, have to remember to push it into an array though might not be necessary/

i want the todo submission form to add a task div on top of it. 
    i also have to add these to the array,

then after that i will make edit button, edit content on the display and the array  or delete content on the display  and in the array for the case of the x  

then i will make home display all items on the array, today will display items due today and this week will display items within the week. 

i think the edit buttons should open up the input form or modal but with the info on that specific div.

also project textcontent should be the relevent topic, either a specific project or the home,today or week section. 

 after all this is done the page should be styled to look good 
    as well as change buttons to svg pic/icons and add one on top.
